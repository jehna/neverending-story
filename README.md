# Neverending story

> A collaborative story that anyone can continue

What happens if anyone could continue a story? This is a concept to test it out!

## See it live!

You can see the website live at:

https://neverending-story-1.herokuapp.com/

## Developing

To run the project locally, first run `yarn` to install dependencies and then
start the local server by running:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This opens the `heroku` local server, builds and starts watching the Typescript
files.

### Building

The frontend can be built using Webpack. If you need to do it manually, run:

```shell
yarn webpack
```

### Deploying

Pushing to Heroku automatically deploys the latest changes to production.

## Features

- Vote for next word
- Vote for deletion of the previous word
- Vote to start a new paragraph

## Contributing

branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
